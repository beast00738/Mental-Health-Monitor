# Mental Health Monitor:using Emotion Recognition and PHQ-9

**Tech Stack**: Python, Flask, TensorFlow, OpenCv
* Developed a Python **Flask-based** system that combines **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **OpenCV**
to **detect signs** of **depression** with an **accuracy of 89%**
* Utilized **emotion recognition** and a **series of questions** to assess usersâ€™ mental health status, **providing
valuable insights** and potential **early intervention**

Our project focuses on creating a depression detection system that uses advanced technology, like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and the PHQ-9 questionnaire to analyze facial expressions and identify signs of depression in real-time. By incorporating the PHQ-9, a trusted tool for assessing depression severity, our system aims to provide timely and accurate support for individuals at risk, leading to better mental health outcomes.

Depression is a common mental health condition that impacts numerous people globally, but it is challenging to detect and intervene early. 
Current diagnostic methods rely on subjective self-reporting or lengthy clinical assessments, resulting in delayed identification and support for individuals at risk. 
We need a simpler and more efficient approach to identify depression early on, allowing timely intervention and assistance for those who need it most.
